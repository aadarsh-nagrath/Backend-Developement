# Comprehensive Guide to scrypt and sCrypt

This guide provides an exhaustive exploration of **scrypt** (a cryptographic key derivation function) and **sCrypt** (a TypeScript-based smart contract language for Bitcoin). Despite their similar names, they serve entirely different purposes: scrypt focuses on secure password hashing and key derivation, while sCrypt is a domain-specific language for developing smart contracts on Bitcoin SV. We’ll cover their histories, mechanics, applications, advantages, limitations, and practical implementations, ensuring a detailed, accessible, and comparative analysis for both technical and non-technical readers.

## Part 1: scrypt (Cryptographic Key Derivation Function)

### Introduction to scrypt

**scrypt** (pronounced "ess crypt") is a **password-based key derivation function (KDF)** designed by **Colin Percival** in 2009 for the **Tarsnap** online backup service. Published as RFC 7914 in 2016 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), scrypt is engineered to be **computationally intensive** and **memory-hard**, making it resistant to brute-force attacks and hardware-based attacks using GPUs, FPGAs, or ASICs. Unlike traditional hash functions like SHA-256, scrypt’s high memory requirements increase the cost of parallelized attacks, making it ideal for **secure password storage** and **cryptocurrency proof-of-work** systems.

scrypt’s primary goal is to thwart large-scale attacks by requiring significant computational and memory resources, ensuring that even with powerful hardware, cracking hashed passwords or deriving keys remains prohibitively expensive. It is widely used in applications like **password hashing**, **key derivation for encryption**, and **cryptocurrency mining** (e.g., Litecoin, Dogecoin).

### What is a Key Derivation Function?

A **key derivation function (KDF)** generates cryptographic keys from input data, such as a password or passphrase, often combined with a **salt** (random data to prevent precomputed attacks). KDFs are designed to be:

1. **Slow**: To deter brute-force attacks by increasing computation time.
2. **Deterministic**: The same input always produces the same output.
3. **Memory-Hard**: Requiring significant memory to limit parallelization on specialized hardware.
4. **Resistant to Precomputation**: Using salts to prevent rainbow table attacks.

scrypt excels in these areas, particularly in memory hardness, distinguishing it from other KDFs like **PBKDF2** (computationally intensive but memory-light) and **bcrypt** (computationally adaptive but less memory-hard).

### How scrypt Works

scrypt combines **PBKDF2** (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with a memory-intensive mixing function called **ROMix**, which uses the **Salsa20/8** stream cipher. Its design ensures that both CPU and memory resources are heavily utilized, creating a **time–memory trade-off** that penalizes attackers attempting to optimize for speed or memory usage.

#### Algorithm Breakdown

The scrypt algorithm takes several parameters and produces a derived key. Below is a detailed explanation of its steps, based on RFC 7914.

**Inputs**:
- **Passphrase**: The password or input string to be hashed (bytes).
- **Salt**: Random bytes to prevent rainbow table attacks.
- **CostFactor (N)**: CPU/memory cost parameter, a power of 2 (e.g., 2^14 = 16384).
- **BlockSizeFactor (r)**: Controls the block size of the mixing function (typically 8).
- **ParallelizationFactor (p)**: Number of parallel computations (e.g., 1 for single-threaded).
- **DesiredKeyLen (dkLen)**: Length of the output key in bytes (e.g., 32 for 256 bits).
- **hLen**: Length of the hash function output (32 bytes for SHA-256).
- **MFlen**: Length of the mixing function output (r * 128 bytes).

**Output**:
- **DerivedKey**: A byte array of length `dkLen`.

**Steps**:

1. **Generate Expensive Salt**:
   - Compute the block size: `blockSize = 128 * BlockSizeFactor` (e.g., 128 * 8 = 1024 bytes).
   - Use PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256 to generate `blockSize * ParallelizationFactor` bytes:
     ```
     [B0...Bp-1] ← PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, Salt, 1, blockSize * p)
     ```
     - Example: For `r=8`, `p=3`, generate 3072 bytes (3 blocks of 1024 bytes).
   - Split the result into `p` blocks (`B0`, `B1`, ..., `Bp-1`), each of size `blockSize`.

2. **Mix Each Block with ROMix**:
   - For each block `Bi` (processed in parallel):
     ```
     Bi ← ROMix(Bi, CostFactor)
     ```
   - **ROMix**:
     - Initialize `X = Block`.
     - Create `CostFactor` copies of `X`:
       ```
       for i = 0 to CostFactor-1:
         Vi ← X
         X ← BlockMix(X)
       ```
     - Perform a pseudo-random access loop:
       ```
       for i = 0 to CostFactor-1:
         j ← Integerify(X) mod CostFactor
         X ← BlockMix(X XOR Vj)
       ```
     - **BlockMix**:
       - Split `B` into `2r` 64-byte chunks.
       - Apply Salsa20/8 to each chunk XORed with the previous result:
         ```
         X ← Salsa20/8(X XOR Bi)
         ```
       - Rearrange output: `Y0∥Y2∥...∥Y2r-2∥Y1∥Y3∥...∥Y2r-1`.
     - **Salsa20/8**: An 8-round stream cipher that hashes 64 bytes to 64 bytes, ensuring diffusion.

3. **Concatenate Blocks**:
   - Combine the mixed blocks to form the expensive salt:
     ```
     expensiveSalt ← B0∥B1∥...∥Bp-1
     ```

4. **Final Key Derivation**:
   - Use PBKDF2 again with the expensive salt to produce the final key:
     ```
     DerivedKey ← PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, DesiredKeyLen)
     ```

#### Pseudocode
```plaintext
Function scrypt(Passphrase, Salt, N, r, p, dkLen):
  blockSize ← 128 * r
  B ← PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, Salt, 1, blockSize * p)
  for i ← 0 to p-1:
    Bi ← ROMix(Bi, N)
  expensiveSalt ← B0∥B1∥...∥Bp-1
  return PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, dkLen)

Function ROMix(Block, N):
  X ← Block
  for i ← 0 to N-1:
    Vi ← X
    X ← BlockMix(X)
  for i ← 0 to N-1:
    j ← Integerify(X) mod N
    X ← BlockMix(X XOR Vj)
  return X

Function BlockMix(B):
  r ← Length(B) / 128
  [B0...B2r-1] ← B
  X ← B2r-1
  for i ← 0 to 2r-1:
    X ← Salsa20/8(X XOR Bi)
    Yi ← X
  return Y0∥Y2∥...∥Y2r-2∥Y1∥Y3∥...∥Y2r-1
```

#### Memory Usage
- **Total Memory**: `N * r * 128` bytes per block, multiplied by `p` for parallelization.
- Example: For `N=2^14 (16384)`, `r=8`, `p=1`, memory usage is:
  ```
  16384 * 8 * 128 = 16 MB
  ```
- Increasing `N` or `r` exponentially increases memory demands, deterring parallel attacks.

#### Time–Memory Trade-Off
- Attackers can reduce memory usage by recomputing vector elements on-the-fly, but this increases computation time significantly.
- scrypt’s design ensures that reducing memory below a threshold incurs a prohibitive computational penalty, making parallelization costly.

### History and Cryptanalysis
- **2009**: Colin Percival created scrypt for Tarsnap, emphasizing memory hardness to counter ASIC-based attacks.
- **2011**: Adopted by cryptocurrencies like Tenebrix, followed by Litecoin and Dogecoin, as a proof-of-work algorithm.
- **2016**: Standardized as RFC 7914, solidifying its use in cryptography.
- **Cryptanalysis**:
  - No practical attacks on scrypt’s security as of 2025.
  - Theoretical analyses (e.g., by Percival and others) confirm its memory-hardness properties.
  - Side-channel attacks (e.g., timing attacks) are possible if implementations leak information, but these are mitigated by careful coding.

### Security Features
1. **Memory Hardness**: Requires large memory (e.g., 16–128 MB), limiting parallelization on GPUs/ASICs.
2. **Salt**: Prevents rainbow table attacks by randomizing outputs.
3. **Configurable Parameters**: `N`, `r`, and `p` allow tuning for specific security needs.
4. **Preimage Resistance**: Infeasible to reverse the derived key to find the passphrase.
5. **Collision Resistance**: Not a primary goal (scrypt is not a hash function like SHA-2), but its output is unique for distinct inputs due to salting.

### Advantages
- **High Security**: Memory-hard design resists brute-force and hardware attacks.
- **Flexibility**: Adjustable parameters (`N`, `r`, `p`) allow scaling with hardware advancements.
- **Standardized**: RFC 7914 ensures interoperability and trust.
- **Versatility**: Suitable for password hashing, key derivation, and proof-of-work.

### Disadvantages
- **Resource Intensive**: High memory and CPU usage can strain servers, especially with high `N` or `p`.
- **Complex Configuration**: Choosing optimal parameters requires expertise to balance security and performance.
- **Slower than Alternatives**: Compared to PBKDF2 or bcrypt, scrypt is slower due to memory demands.
- **Limited Adoption**: Less common than bcrypt in some frameworks due to complexity.

### Use Cases
1. **Password Hashing**:
   - Secure storage of user passwords in databases.
   - Example: Web applications requiring high resistance to brute-force attacks.
2. **Key Derivation**:
   - Generating encryption keys from passphrases for secure file storage.
   - Example: Tarsnap’s backup encryption.
3. **Cryptocurrency Mining**:
   - Proof-of-work algorithm in Litecoin, Dogecoin, and others.
   - Example: Miners use GPUs to compute scrypt hashes for block validation.
4. **Authentication Systems**:
   - Deriving session keys or tokens in secure protocols.

### Implementation Example (Python with `scrypt` Library)
```python
import scrypt
import os

# Parameters
password = "mypassword".encode()
salt = os.urandom(32)  # Random 32-byte salt
N = 2**14  # CPU/memory cost factor
r = 8      # Block size factor
p = 1      # Parallelization factor
dkLen = 32 # Desired key length (bytes)

# Derive key
key = scrypt.hash(password, salt, N=N, r=r, p=p, dklen=dkLen)
print(key.hex())
# Example Output: 5e8b... (64 hex digits for 32 bytes)
```

#### Notes
- Use a cryptographically secure random salt (e.g., `os.urandom`).
- Typical parameters: `N=2^14`, `r=8`, `p=1` for 16 MB memory; increase `N` for stronger security.
- Store the salt, `N`, `r`, `p`, and derived key in the database for verification.

### Comparison with Other KDFs
| Function | Memory-Hard | Adaptive | Speed | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------|----------|
| **scrypt** | Yes         | Yes      | Very Slow | Password hashing, crypto mining |
| **bcrypt** | Moderate    | Yes      | Slow      | Password hashing |
| **PBKDF2** | No          | Yes      | Moderate  | Key derivation, password hashing |
| **Argon2** | Yes         | Yes      | Very Slow | Password hashing |

- **scrypt vs. bcrypt**: scrypt is more memory-hard, but bcrypt is simpler and more widely supported.
- **scrypt vs. PBKDF2**: scrypt’s memory hardness makes it more secure against hardware attacks; PBKDF2 is faster but less secure.
- **scrypt vs. Argon2**: Argon2 (2015 Password Hashing Competition winner) is more modern, with better side-channel resistance and flexibility, but scrypt remains viable.

### Best Practices
1. **Choose Parameters Wisely**:
   - Start with `N=2^14`, `r=8`, `p=1` (16 MB memory).
   - Increase `N` (e.g., `2^16`) for high-security applications, but test performance.
2. **Use Random Salts**: Generate 32-byte salts with a secure RNG.
3. **Secure Implementation**:
   - Avoid side-channel leaks (e.g., timing attacks).
   - Use vetted libraries like `scrypt` (Python), `libsodium` (C), or `crypto` (Node.js).
4. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Ensure server resources can handle scrypt’s memory/CPU demands.
   - Benchmark with expected user load.
5. **Plan for Upgrades**:
   - Increase `N` periodically to counter hardware improvements.
   - Store parameters with the hash for future verification.

### Future Outlook
- **Continued Relevance**: scrypt remains secure for password hashing and key derivation, though Argon2 is gaining traction.
- **Cryptocurrency Evolution**: As mining hardware improves, scrypt-based cryptocurrencies may adjust parameters or switch algorithms.
- **Standardization**: RFC 7914 ensures long-term support, but newer KDFs like Argon2 may dominate future standards.

## Part 2: sCrypt (Smart Contract Language for Bitcoin SV)

### Introduction to sCrypt

**sCrypt** (not to be confused with scrypt) is a **TypeScript-based domain-specific language (DSL)** for developing **smart contracts** on the **Bitcoin SV (BSV)** blockchain. Developed by **sCrypt Inc.**, it aims to simplify and secure smart contract development by leveraging TypeScript’s syntax and static typing, compiling contracts to native **Bitcoin Script**. sCrypt enables developers to build **decentralized applications (dApps)** on Bitcoin SV, offering advantages in **familiarity**, **type safety**, **performance**, and **security**. It is particularly suited for applications requiring trustless execution, such as financial contracts, multi-signature wallets, and escrow services.

Unlike Ethereum’s Solidity, which runs on a virtual machine, sCrypt compiles directly to Bitcoin Script, ensuring efficient execution within Bitcoin’s constrained scripting environment. This makes sCrypt a powerful tool for developers seeking to harness Bitcoin SV’s scalability and low transaction fees for complex smart contracts.

### What is a Smart Contract?

A **smart contract** is a self-executing program stored on a blockchain that automatically enforces the terms of an agreement when predefined conditions are met. Smart contracts on Bitcoin SV use **Bitcoin Script**, a stack-based scripting language, to define locking and unlocking conditions for transactions. sCrypt abstracts the complexity of Bitcoin Script, allowing developers to write contracts in a high-level, TypeScript-like syntax.

### How sCrypt Works

sCrypt provides a framework for writing, compiling, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts on Bitcoin SV. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its workflow:

#### 1. Writing a Smart Contract
- Developers write contracts in TypeScript, using sCrypt’s library (`scrypt-ts`) for constructs like `@method`, `@prop`, and `assert`.
- Contracts are classes extending `SmartContract`, with properties (`@prop`) and methods (`@method`) defining state and logic.
- Example: A `Counter` contract that increments a value on-chain:
  ```typescript
  import { SmartContract, method, prop, assert, ByteString, hash256 } from 'scrypt-ts';

  export class Counter extends SmartContract {
    @prop(true)
    count: bigint;

    constructor(count: bigint) {
      super(...arguments);
      this.count = count;
    }

    @method()
    public incrementOnChain() {
      this.increment();
      const amount: bigint = this.ctx.utxo.value;
      const outputs: ByteString = this.buildStateOutput(amount) + this.buildChangeOutput();
      assert(this.ctx.hashOutputs == hash256(outputs), 'hashOutputs mismatch');
    }

    @method()
    increment(): void {
      this.count++;
    }
  }
  ```

#### 2. Compiling the Contract
- The `scrypt-cli` tool compiles TypeScript code to Bitcoin Script using:
  ```
  npx scrypt-cli compile
  ```
- Output: A JSON artifact containing the compiled script, ABI, and metadata.

#### 3. Deploying the Contract
- Deployment involves creating a transaction that locks funds to the contract’s script.
- Example deployment code for the `Counter` contract:
  ```typescript
  import { Counter } from '../src/contracts/counter';
  import { getDefaultSigner } from '../utils/txHelper';

  async function main() {
    await Counter.loadArtifact();
    const amount = 1;
    const instance = new Counter(0n);
    await instance.connect(getDefaultSigner());
    const deployTx = await instance.deploy(amount);
    console.log(`Counter contract deployed: TXID ${deployTx.id}`);
  }

  main();
  ```
- Run deployment:
  ```
  npx scrypt-cli deploy
  ```

#### 4. Interacting with the Contract
- Users interact with deployed contracts by sending transactions that call public methods (e.g., `incrementOnChain`).
- Wallets or dApps use Bitcoin SV’s transaction format to unlock the contract’s script.
- Example: Calling `incrementOnChain` updates the counter state on-chain.

#### 5. Front-End Integration
- sCrypt supports modern frameworks like **React**, **Angular**, **Next.js**, **Svelte**, and **Vue.js** for building dApp front-ends.
- Example: A React app can use sCrypt’s SDK to interact with a deployed contract.

### Key Features
1. **TypeScript Syntax**:
   - Familiar to JavaScript/TypeScript developers, reducing the learning curve.
   - Example: Classes, interfaces, and type annotations improve code readability.
2. **Static Typing**:
   - Catches errors at compile-time, enhancing reliability.
   - Example: Type mismatches in contract parameters are detected early.
3. **Native Compilation**:
   - Compiles to Bitcoin Script, ensuring efficient execution without a virtual machine.
   - Example: No gas fees, only standard Bitcoin transaction fees.
4. **Security Features**:
   - Built-in checks (e.g., `assert`, `checkSig`) prevent common vulnerabilities.
   - Example: Signature verification ensures only authorized parties can unlock funds.
5. **Scalability**:
   - Bitcoin SV’s high throughput supports complex dApps.
   - Example: Multi-signature or escrow contracts handle high transaction volumes.

### History and Development
- **2018**: sCrypt Inc. founded to enhance Bitcoin SV’s smart contract capabilities.
- **2019**: sCrypt language introduced, leveraging TypeScript for accessibility.
- **2020–2025**: Continuous updates, including CLI improvements, framework support, and example contracts (e.g., multi-signature, escrow).
- **Adoption**: Used in dApps for finance, gaming, and tokenized assets on Bitcoin SV.

### Advantages
- **Developer-Friendly**: TypeScript syntax lowers barriers for web developers.
- **Type Safety**: Reduces runtime errors in critical financial contracts.
- **Performance**: Native Bitcoin Script ensures fast execution.
- **Security**: Static typing and built-in checks minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability**: Bitcoin SV’s large block sizes support high-throughput dApps.

### Disadvantages
- **Limited Ecosystem**: Bitcoin SV’s smaller community compared to Ethereum limits adoption.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with Bitcoin Script may need time to understand sCrypt’s constraints.
- **Dependency on Bitcoin SV**: Tied to BSV’s success and scalability claims.
- **Tooling Maturity**: sCrypt’s CLI and libraries are less mature than Ethereum’s Truffle or Hardhat.

### Use Cases
1. **Financial Contracts**:
   - Multi-signature wallets requiring multiple approvals.
   - Example: A `MultiSigPayment` contract:
     ```typescript
     import { assert, method, prop, PubKey, Addr, Sig, SmartContract, FixedArray, pubKey2Addr } from 'scrypt-ts';

     export class MultiSigPayment extends SmartContract {
       @prop()
       readonly addresses: FixedArray<Addr, 3>;

       constructor(addresses: FixedArray<Addr, 3>) {
         super(...arguments);
         this.addresses = addresses;
       }

       @method()
       public unlock(signatures: FixedArray<Sig, 3>, publicKeys: FixedArray<PubKey, 3>) {
         for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
           assert(pubKey2Addr(publicKeys[i]) == this.addresses[i], 'public key hash mismatch');
         }
         assert(this.checkMultiSig(signatures, publicKeys), 'checkMultiSig failed');
       }
     }
     ```
2. **Escrow Services**:
   - Trustless transactions with arbitration.
   - Example: A `BlindEscrow` contract:
     ```typescript
     import { assert, ByteString, method, prop, PubKey, Addr, Sig, SmartContract, toByteString, pubKey2Addr, hash256, int2ByteString, byteString2Int, reverseByteString, exit } from 'scrypt-ts';
     import { SECP256K1, Signature } from 'scrypt-ts-lib';

     export class BlindEscrow extends SmartContract {
       static readonly RELEASE_BY_SELLER = 0n;
       static readonly RELEASE_BY_ARBITER = 1n;
       static readonly RETURN_BY_BUYER = 2n;
       static readonly RETURN_BY_ARBITER = 3n;

       @prop()
       seller: Addr;
       @prop()
       buyer: Addr;
       @prop()
       arbiter: Addr;
       @prop()
       escrowNonce: ByteString;

       constructor(seller: Addr, buyer: Addr, arbiter: Addr, escrowNonce: ByteString) {
         super(...arguments);
         this.seller = seller;
         this.buyer = buyer;
         this.arbiter = arbiter;
         this.escrowNonce = escrowNonce;
       }

       @method()
       public spend(spenderSig: Sig, spenderPubKey: PubKey, oracleSig: Signature, oraclePubKey: PubKey, action: bigint) {
         let spender = Addr(toByteString('0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'));
         let oracle = Addr(toByteString('0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'));

         if (action == BlindEscrow.RELEASE_BY_SELLER) {
           spender = this.buyer;
           oracle = this.seller;
         } else if (action == BlindEscrow.RELEASE_BY_ARBITER) {
           spender = this.buyer;
           oracle = this.arbiter;
         } else if (action == BlindEscrow.RETURN_BY_BUYER) {
           spender = this.seller;
           oracle = this.buyer;
         } else if (action == BlindEscrow.RETURN_BY_ARBITER) {
           spender = this.seller;
           oracle = this.arbiter;
         } else {
           exit(false);
         }

         assert(pubKey2Addr(spenderPubKey) == spender, 'Wrong spender pub key');
         assert(pubKey2Addr(oraclePubKey) == oracle, 'Wrong oracle pub key');

         const oracleMsg: ByteString = this.escrowNonce + int2ByteString(action);
         const hashInt = byteString2Int(reverseByteString(hash256(oracleMsg), 32n) + toByteString('00'));
         assert(SECP256K1.verifySig(hashInt, oracleSig, SECP256K1.pubKey2Point(oraclePubKey)), 'Oracle sig invalid');
         assert(this.checkSig(spenderSig, spenderPubKey), 'Spender sig invalid');
       }
     }
     ```
3. **Tokenized Assets**:
   - Contracts for issuing and transferring tokens on Bitcoin SV.
4. **Gaming dApps**:
   - Trustless betting or reward systems.
5. **Supply Chain**:
   - Contracts for tracking goods with transparent ownership.

### Future Outlook
- **Adoption Growth**: As Bitcoin SV gains traction, sCrypt’s ecosystem may expand.
- **Tooling Improvements**: Enhanced CLI, IDE plugins, and debugging tools.
- **Interoperability**: Potential integration with other blockchains or Layer-2 solutions.
- **Competition**: sCrypt competes with Solidity (Ethereum), Clarity (Stacks), and others, but its focus on Bitcoin SV’s scalability is unique.

## Part 3: bcrypt (Password-Hashing Function)

### Introduction to bcrypt

**bcrypt** is a **password-hashing function** designed by **Niels Provos** and **David Mazières** in 1999, based on the **Blowfish cipher**. Presented at USENIX, bcrypt is engineered for **secure password storage**, incorporating a **salt** to prevent rainbow table attacks and an **adaptive work factor** to resist brute-force attacks as hardware improves. Its deliberate slowness and scalability make it a cryptographic standard for protecting passwords in databases, widely adopted in frameworks like **Node.js**, **Spring Security**, **Django**, and **Laravel**.

bcrypt produces a **60-character** output string (184 bits), including the salt, cost factor, and hash, ensuring that even identical passwords yield unique hashes. Its design addresses the limitations of fast hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) and outdated algorithms (e.g., UNIX’s `crypt`), providing robust security for authentication systems.

### What is Password Hashing?

**Password hashing** transforms a password into a fixed-length string (hash) that cannot be reversed, used to verify user credentials without storing plaintext passwords. A secure password-hashing function should:

1. **Be Slow**: To deter brute-force attacks.
2. **Use a Salt**: To prevent precomputed attacks (e.g., rainbow tables).
3. **Be Adaptive**: To scale with hardware improvements.
4. **Be Preimage Resistant**: Infeasible to reverse the hash.
5. **Produce Unique Outputs**: Even for identical inputs, due to salting.

bcrypt excels in these areas, making it ideal for password storage where security trumps speed.

### How bcrypt Works

bcrypt leverages the **Blowfish cipher**’s expensive key setup phase, modified as **EksBlowfish** (Expensive Key Schedule Blowfish), to create a slow, secure hashing process. It operates in two phases, incorporating a salt and an adjustable work factor (cost).

#### Algorithm Breakdown

**Inputs**:
- **Password**: The input string to hash (up to 72 bytes; longer inputs are truncated).
- **Salt**: A 128-bit (16-byte) random value, encoded in 22 Base64 characters.
- **Cost Factor**: A logarithmic work factor (e.g., 10 means 2^10 iterations, typically 10–14).
- **Magic Value**: A fixed 192-bit string (`OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt`).

**Output**:
- A 60-character string containing:
  - Version identifier (e.g., `$2a$`, `$2b$`, `$2y$`).
  - Cost factor (2 digits, e.g., `10`).
  - Salt (22 Base64 characters).
  - Hash (31 Base64 characters).

**Steps**:

1. **Phase 1: EksBlowfish Setup**:
   - Initialize the Blowfish state using the cost factor, salt, and password.
   - Perform **key stretching**:
     - Derive subkeys from the password (primary key) to create a longer, stronger key.
     - Run an expensive key schedule with `2^cost` iterations, slowing down computation.
   - Output: An initialized EksBlowfish state.

2. **Phase 2: Encryption Loop**:
   - Encrypt the magic value (`OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt`) 64 times using EksBlowfish in ECB mode.
   - Concatenate the cost factor, salt, and encryption result.
   - Encode in Base64 with a custom alphabet (`./ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789`).
   - Prefix with the version (e.g., `$2a$`) and cost (e.g., `$10$`).

**Output Format**:
```
$2a$10$3euPcmQFCiblsZeEu5s7p.9OVHgeHWFDk9nhMqZ0m/3pd/lhwZgES
|   |  |  |_________________|_|
|   |  |        Salt         Hash
|   |  Cost (2^10 iterations)
|   Version
```

#### Pseudocode
```plaintext
Function bcrypt(Password, Salt, Cost):
  State ← EksBlowfishSetup(Cost, Salt, Password)
  Ciphertext ← OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt
  for i ← 1 to 64:
    Ciphertext ← EksBlowfishEncrypt(Ciphertext, State)
  Hash ← Concatenate(Cost, Salt, Ciphertext)
  return "$2a$" + Cost + "$" + Base64(Salt + Hash)
```

#### Work Factor
- The cost factor (`2^cost`) determines the number of iterations in the key schedule.
- Example: Cost=12 means 2^12 = 4096 iterations, taking ~250ms on modern hardware.
- Doubling the cost (e.g., 12 to 13) doubles the computation time, scaling with hardware.

### History and Cryptanalysis
- **1999**: Provos and Mazières presented bcrypt at USENIX, addressing the weaknesses of UNIX’s `crypt`.
- **2000s**: Adopted in OpenBSD, later in web frameworks (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Node.js).
- **2010s**: Became a standard for password hashing due to its adaptive design.
- **Cryptanalysis**:
  - No practical attacks on bcrypt as of 2025.
  - Vulnerable to side-channel attacks (e.g., timing) if poorly implemented.
  - Limited to 72-byte passwords; longer inputs are truncated, which can be mitigated by pre-hashing (e.g., with SHA-256).

### Security Features
1. **Deliberate Slowness**: Slow key setup resists brute-force attacks (e.g., ~250ms per hash at cost=12).
2. **Salt**: 128-bit salt prevents rainbow table attacks.
3. **Adaptive Cost**: Increase cost factor to counter faster hardware.
4. **Preimage Resistance**: Blowfish’s strong design ensures hashes cannot be reversed.
5. **No Collisions**: Salting ensures unique outputs for identical passwords.

### Advantages
- **Scalability**: Adaptive cost factor keeps bcrypt secure as hardware improves.
- **Simplicity**: Built-in salting and easy-to-use APIs in most languages.
- **Wide Support**: Available in Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, and more.
- **Proven Security**: Battle-tested for over 20 years with no major vulnerabilities.

### Disadvantages
- **Password Length Limit**: Truncates passwords beyond 72 bytes, potentially reducing entropy.
- **Memory Usage**: Less memory-hard than scrypt or Argon2, making it slightly less resistant to GPU attacks.
- **Performance**: Slower than fast hashes (e.g., SHA-256), unsuitable for non-password use cases.
- **Configuration Risk**: Incorrect cost settings (e.g., too low) can weaken security.

### Use Cases
1. **Password Storage**:
   - Storing user credentials in web applications.
   - Example: Authentication in Node.js or Django apps.
2. **Authentication Systems**:
   - Verifying user logins by comparing hashed passwords.
3. **API Security**:
   - Hashing API tokens or secrets for secure storage.
4. **Legacy Systems**:
   - Replacing outdated hashing algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1.

### Implementation Example (Node.js with `bcrypt`)
```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 12;
const password = 'DFGh5546*%^__90';

// Technique 1: Separate salt and hash
bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds)
  .then(salt => {
    console.log(`Salt: ${salt}`);
    return bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
  })
  .then(hash => {
    console.log(`Hash: ${hash}`);
    // Store hash in database
  })
  .catch(err => console.error(err));

// Technique 2: Auto-generate salt and hash
bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds)
  .then(hash => {
    console.log(`Hash: ${hash}`);
    // Store hash in database
  })
  .catch(err => console.error(err));

// Validate password
const storedHash = '$2b$12$3euPcmQFCiblsZeEu5s7p.9OVHgeHWFDk9nhMqZ0m/3pd/lhwZgES';
bcrypt.compare(password, storedHash)
  .then(res => {
    console.log(`Password match: ${res}`); // true
  })
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

#### Notes
- Use a cost factor of 10–14, balancing security and user experience (e.g., ~250ms at cost=12).
- Store the full 60-character hash, which includes the salt and cost.
- Use asynchronous methods (`bcrypt.hash`, `bcrypt.compare`) for non-blocking performance.

### Performance Example
On a 2017 MacBook Pro (2.8 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM):
- Cost=10: ~65ms
- Cost=12: ~254ms
- Cost=14: ~1015ms
- Cost=16: ~4088ms

Time grows exponentially with cost, allowing bcrypt to scale with hardware improvements.

### Comparison with Other Hashing Functions
| Function | Memory-Hard | Adaptive | Speed | Password Length | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **bcrypt** | Moderate    | Yes      | Slow      | 72 bytes max    | Password hashing |
| **scrypt** | Yes         | Yes      | Very Slow | Unlimited       | Password hashing, crypto mining |
| **PBKDF2** | No          | Yes      | Moderate  | Unlimited       | Key derivation, password hashing |
| **Argon2** | Yes         | Yes      | Very Slow | Unlimited       | Password hashing |

- **bcrypt vs. scrypt**: bcrypt is simpler and more widely supported, but scrypt’s memory hardness offers better resistance to GPU/ASIC attacks.
- **bcrypt vs. PBKDF2**: bcrypt’s built-in salting and moderate memory usage make it more secure for passwords than PBKDF2.
- **bcrypt vs. Argon2**: Argon2 is more modern, with stronger memory hardness and side-channel resistance, but bcrypt’s maturity and support keep it relevant.

### Best Practices
1. **Set Appropriate Cost**:
   - Start with cost=12 (~250ms), adjust based on UX and hardware.
   - Increase cost every 1–2 years to match hardware improvements.
2. **Use Random Salts**:
   - bcrypt generates salts automatically; never reuse salts.
3. **Secure Storage**:
   - Store the full 60-character hash in the database.
   - Protect the database against SQL injection and unauthorized access.
4. **Handle Long Passwords**:
   - Pre-hash passwords longer than 72 bytes with SHA-256 to avoid truncation.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const crypto = require('crypto');
     const longPassword = 'a'.repeat(100);
     const preHashed = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(longPassword).digest('hex');
     bcrypt.hash(preHashed, 12).then(hash => console.log(hash));
     ```
5. **Migration Strategy**:
   - When increasing cost, hash new passwords with the higher cost and rehash old passwords on login.
6. **Use Vetted Libraries**:
   - Node.js: `bcrypt` or `bcryptjs`.
   - Python: `bcrypt`.
   - Java: Spring Security’s `BCryptPasswordEncoder`.
   - PHP: `password_hash` with `PASSWORD_BCRYPT`.

### Future Outlook
- **Continued Use**: bcrypt remains a standard for password hashing due to its simplicity and maturity.
- **Competition**: Argon2’s superior design may overtake bcrypt in new applications.
- **Adaptability**: Increasing cost factors will keep bcrypt secure against future hardware.
- **Framework Integration**: Expect deeper integration in frameworks like Next.js and Django.
