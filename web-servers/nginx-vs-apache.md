## Nginx vs Apache (httpd): Practical Comparison for Backend Engineers

This guide contrasts Nginx and Apache across architecture, performance, configuration, features, security, and operational concerns. It also includes a decision matrix and common deployment patterns.

### Snapshot: When to Pick Which
- **Pick Nginx**: High concurrency/static assets/reverse proxy/load balancer, TLS termination, container/K8s ingress, WebSocket/gRPC, low memory footprint.
- **Pick Apache**: Complex per-directory rules and legacy `.htaccess` needs, deep `mod_*` ecosystem, existing LAMP stacks, built-in balancer manager, compatibility with older apps.
- **Use Both**: Nginx in front (TLS, caching, WAF, static) and Apache behind (legacy app, complex rewrites), or Apache behind for PHP‑FPM while Nginx handles edge concerns.

### Architecture
- **Nginx**: Event-driven, non-blocking I/O; master/worker with small memory per connection. Best for very high concurrency.
- **Apache**: Process/thread-based via MPMs (`event`, `worker`, `prefork`). Flexible but higher per-connection overhead, especially with `prefork`.

### Performance & Resource Usage
- **Static files**: Nginx generally faster with lower CPU and memory.
- **Dynamic apps**: Comparable when using FastCGI/Proxy to app servers (PHP‑FPM, Gunicorn, etc.). Apache can be competitive with `event` MPM.
- **Keep-alive**: Nginx excels at many idle connections; Apache `event` MPM mitigates but still heavier.

### Reverse Proxy & Load Balancing
- Both support reverse proxying, load balancing, health checks (advanced features built-in on Apache; advanced active health checks on NGINX Plus).
- **Nginx**: Simple, performant configs for proxying HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC; supports `stream` (TCP/UDP).
- **Apache**: Rich balancer features via `mod_proxy_balancer` and friendly balancer-manager UI.

### TLS/HTTP2/HTTP3
- **Nginx**: Excellent TLS termination; HTTP/2 stable; HTTP/3/QUIC available with proper build.
- **Apache**: Strong TLS; HTTP/2 via `mod_http2`; HTTP/3 not mainstream in stable packages (use a front proxy for QUIC).

### Configuration & Extensibility
- **Nginx**: Declarative blocks (`http`, `server`, `location`, `upstream`). No `.htaccess`. Centralized config encourages consistency and performance.
- **Apache**: Highly flexible with `.htaccess` and per-directory overrides; huge module ecosystem (`mod_security2`, `mod_evasive`, `mod_proxy_*`, etc.).

### Security
- Both can be hardened with modern TLS ciphers, headers, rate limiting, and WAFs.
- **Nginx**: Rate/conn limiting built-in; common to pair with external WAF or NGINX App Protect. Minimal attack surface when modules are limited.
- **Apache**: First-class ModSecurity integration; `.htaccess` can be risky if misused (prefer `AllowOverride None`).

### Observability
- Both provide access/error logs and custom formats (including JSON). Nginx has `stub_status`; Apache has `mod_status`. Prometheus exporters exist for both.

### Admin & Operations
- Zero-downtime reloads on both (`nginx -s reload`, `apachectl graceful`).
- Nginx config testing via `nginx -t`; Apache via `apachectl configtest`.
- Package ecosystems: both widely available; Nginx often used as K8s ingress.

### Common Deployment Patterns
1) Nginx front, Apache app:
```
Internet → Nginx (TLS, caching, WAF, static) → Apache (PHP‑FPM/legacy rewrites) → App
```
2) Nginx only:
```
Internet → Nginx (TLS, reverse proxy, LB) → App servers (Node/Golang/Python)
```
3) Apache only:
```
Internet → Apache (TLS, proxy/balancer) → App servers (PHP‑FPM, Python, etc.)
```

### Quick Decision Matrix

| Area | Nginx | Apache |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | Event-driven, non-blocking | Process/thread (MPMs) |
| Static file performance | Excellent | Good |
| High concurrency | Excellent | Good (event MPM), weaker with prefork |
| Reverse proxy | Excellent; simple config | Excellent; rich modules |
| Load balancing | Strong; advanced in NGINX Plus | Strong; balancer-manager |
| WebSocket/gRPC | First-class | Supported (proxy_wstunnel, proxy_http2) |
| HTTP/2 | Mature | Mature |
| HTTP/3/QUIC | Available with proper build | Generally not in stable builds |
| Config style | Centralized, declarative | Centralized + optional `.htaccess` |
| Module ecosystem | Smaller core, stable | Very large and flexible |
| WAF | External or NGINX Plus/App Protect | ModSecurity + OWASP CRS |
| Ease for legacy LAMP | Good with PHP‑FPM | Excellent |
| K8s ingress | Very common | Less common |

### Example: Equivalent Minimal Reverse Proxy
- Nginx:
```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name api.example.com;
  location / {
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
  }
}
```

- Apache:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName api.example.com
  ProxyPreserveHost On
  ProxyPass        "/"  "http://127.0.0.1:3000/"
  ProxyPassReverse "/"  "http://127.0.0.1:3000/"
</VirtualHost>
```

### Practical Recommendations
- For greenfield microservices and high-concurrency APIs, prefer Nginx at the edge.
- For legacy LAMP or heavy `.htaccess` use, Apache remains strong; consider Nginx in front for TLS/caching.
- For HTTP/3 adoption today, place Nginx or another QUIC-capable proxy in front of Apache.
- Keep configurations centralized, version-controlled, and validated in CI.
